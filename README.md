# mx-audioplayer - specific-jobs
Hello everyone,

I’ve made a small update to the mx-audioplayer code, allowing each DJ booth to be restricted to specific jobs. It’s a minor change, but some of you might find it useful. Previously, other factions that were also included in the allowed jobs list could access and play music without permission. Now, you can assign specific jobs to each DJ booth, ensuring only authorized jobs have access.

# installation
You just need to drag both folders into the main directory of mx-audioplayer and replace the old files. However, make sure to back up the old files before replacing them, just in case you need to restore them.
